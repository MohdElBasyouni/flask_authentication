Sample Code for Flask API Authentication, Add/Remove Background Task and Manage API Credit.

This sample code is used to illustrate how to create a Flask API, manage Authentication over the API requests and check/update credit to control the follow of the API requests through registrtaion.

In that sample code also, I have added how to add and remove a background task.
